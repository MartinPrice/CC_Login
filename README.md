Coding Club
Charity Auction website
This is the code for a series of lessons I wrote for Coding Club.
It's an introduction to PHP so the code does not follow best practice.
The lessons are designed for students who have completed a basic Python course.
It takes them on a journey to create a Charity Auction website that,
with a minimal modification by the College's web developer, can by published
and used as part of a College Charity event.
